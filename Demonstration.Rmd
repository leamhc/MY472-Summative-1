## Function

This is a function to multiply the first column of a dataset.

```{r}
transform_data <- function(data, x) {
data[, 1] <- data[, 1] * x
  return(data)
}
```

## Demonostration

Let's use the built-in database mtcars as an example. 
This is what the database looks like.
```{r}
mtcars
```

If you use the function on a dataset, setting x to be three. 
The first column "mpg" will be multiplied by three.

```{r}
data <- mtcars
transformed_data <- transform_data(data, 3)
print(transformed_data)

```
